00:00 Well, our time together is up, at least in this course.
00:03 I want to say thank you for taking our Responder Mini Course.
00:06 I hope you had a great time.
00:07 I hope you learn something fun
00:08 and I really appreciate you spending this time together.
00:11 Go out there and build something really amazing
00:14 with Responder or with Vue JS
00:17 or with some other web framework.
00:19 And also, do consider taking other courses
00:22 at training.talkpython.fm.
00:24 We have a bunch and we're always building more.
00:26 All right, goodbye and thank you.
