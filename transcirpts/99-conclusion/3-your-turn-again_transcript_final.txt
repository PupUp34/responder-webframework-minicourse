00:00 Remember at the beginning when I told you
00:01 there are two ways to follow along?
00:03 Well, you've gone through level one
00:05 you've watched all the videos
00:06 and maybe you followed along
00:08 and built out that movie service as we did.
00:11 Well it's time to keep building and follow along.
00:13 Now it's your turn!
00:15 So visit the URL at the bottom or just go to the GitHub repo
00:18 and go to Your Turn.
00:19 You'll see a bunch of steps on how you can explore
00:21 create your own service using some Mockaroo fake data
00:25 and build something uniquely yours
00:28 and I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun.
00:29 So don't forget the step
00:30 to go and do a Your Turn and explore
00:33 the steps are right there.
