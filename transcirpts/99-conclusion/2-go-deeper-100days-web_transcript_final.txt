00:00 We covered quite a bit actually in this course,
00:01 We talked about Responder,
00:04 a bunch of stuff with HTTP endpoints.
00:06 We talked about Mockeroo, and we even did
00:07 a little bit of Vue JS.
00:09 But, it is nothing compared to what we cover
00:11 in the 100 Days of Web in Python course.
00:14 This represents only 1/100th of what we're covering.
00:18 Eh, you throw in the Vue JS, maybe 1.5%
00:22 of what is covered in the 100 Days of Web course.
00:24 So, if you want to go deeper, definitely
00:26 be on the look-out for when we release this course,
00:29 and maybe check out training.talkpython.fm to see
00:32 if it's already released if you're watching this
00:34 a little bit later after we've recorded this.
00:36 It's a super fun course and if you like these kind of things,
00:39 you should definitely check out the full course.
