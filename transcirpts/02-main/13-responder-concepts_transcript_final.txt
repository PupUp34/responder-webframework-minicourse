00:00 Let's close down our chapter on Responder
00:02 by quickly looking at some of the core concepts.
00:04 Incredibly, what you see on the screen here
00:06 is a complete Responder application
00:09 assuming that you don't count that index file
00:11 that's just the static HTML or dynamic HTML.
00:14 So, what are we going to do to get started
00:16 with a templated HTML page-based view?
00:19 Come in here and create an API from responder.api
00:22 similar to Flask's app.
00:24 We're going to add a route as a decorator
00:26 through api.route and we saw
00:28 that you can even use curly braces like f-string
00:31 like syntax to define places where data
00:34 is passed in the URL.
00:36 Then we're going to use api.template
00:37 and pass the relative file name
00:40 of the template we want to use.
00:41 It assumes that you're talking about the
00:43 template's folder, so within there
00:45 it's the home directory in the index.html file.
00:47 We're also here passing a user key
00:50 which has the value u.
00:52 It didn't really say where u comes from
00:53 but, you know, you get it from somewhere, right?
00:55 And you're passing along values like this that can
00:57 be used inside that Jinja2 template.
01:00 And then, what we do is we just set
01:01 the content of the response.
01:03 It's a mutable object, so we don't return values
01:05 we just change response.
01:07 Gives us a bare one, we set some values in it
01:09 uses that result to generate the page.
01:11 That was for a page backed by a template.
01:14 What if we want a JSON-based API view?
01:17 Well it's pretty similar.
01:18 We're going to have the route again
01:19 and see we're passing the keyword this time.
01:22 And that key word appears in the search methods signature.
01:25 Then, we're just going to create a JSON serializable thing.
01:29 The simplest is probably a dictionary
01:31 or list of dictionaries, things like that.
01:32 And we're going to set the media element right there.
01:35 And by setting media, we're telling it
01:37 here is a JSON object.
01:39 I want you to serialize and send back as
01:41 part of this API response with the content type being JSON.
01:45 That's it, that's Responder!
01:46 Remember, all the key features I told you
01:49 about at the beginning, that are not shown or covered here.
01:52 Web sockets, async capabilities, background tasks.
01:56 All that kind of stuff is in there
01:57 but we don't have time to cover it.
01:58 You can go explore it yourself, it looks really cool.
