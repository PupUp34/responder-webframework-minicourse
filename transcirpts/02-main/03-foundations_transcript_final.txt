00:00 When you first look at Responder, you might think
00:02 of it as an entirely new, from scratch, API.
00:05 But the reality is, is it's more of a reinterpretation
00:09 of existing frameworks.
00:10 So, for example, two of the main building blocks
00:13 of Responder are Starlette and API Star.
00:16 We've talked about API Star already.
00:19 It's a cool way to build APIs of course from Tom Christie
00:22 also of Django Rest Framework fame.
00:25 And then Starlette is an ASGI framework
00:28 that really works well.
00:29 So you'll see a lot of the features
00:31 of Responder are really coming from, especially Starlette.
00:36 These two things are foundational elements
00:38 for working with Responder and that's kind of cool
00:41 because that means it's not entirely new
00:43 and from scratch, but it kind of builds on the work
00:46 and the growth of these other frameworks.
