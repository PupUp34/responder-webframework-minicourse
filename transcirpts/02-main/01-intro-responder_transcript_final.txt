00:00 Hello and welcome to Day 50.
00:02 We're going to spend this one day chapter on Responder
00:07 a new async web framework created by Kenneth Reitz.
00:11 Maybe you've heard of Responder, but very likely not.
00:13 It's quite, quite new.
00:15 It's a great async-capable web framework.
00:19 Why are we only spending one day on this
00:21 and not diving deep into it?
00:23 Well, it's really quite new and I'm not sure
00:26 if it's going to survive
00:27 or if it's going to gain all the traction
00:28 so right now we're just throwin' it out there
00:30 as another topic that you can cover.
00:33 Something that you can use. I really like the API even just building small apps with it
00:37 it's made me smile.
00:38 It seems like there's some
00:39 really great stuff happenin' here.
00:41 So we're going to build a quick, simple API and website
00:46 within Responder and I think that'll make you smile as well.
