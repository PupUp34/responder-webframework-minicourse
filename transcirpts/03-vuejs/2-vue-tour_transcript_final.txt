00:00 Now, keeping with our theme
00:01 of a high speed fast mini course
00:03 this is not a deep dive on Vue JS.
00:06 But, like I said, I did want to provide this app
00:08 for you to play with, and so let me
00:10 just give you a quick tour
00:11 so it makes a little bit of sense.
00:13 You can see down here we have our movie service running.
00:16 I'm going to put that away, so we have room
00:17 but it's going to be running down there the whole time.
00:20 Now, let's open up this Movie Explorer
00:22 and notice it has a views, as in HTML
00:25 it has JS and it has CSS.
00:27 CSS, we don't care too much about
00:29 but let's look over here at the index.
00:32 Actually, let's start with the site.
00:34 So, here, you can see it's using the localhost API
00:36 you can also use the public API
00:39 that won't be a Responder that's Pyramid
00:40 but it doesn't really matter
00:41 if you just want to play with Vue
00:43 you can use that without running the little app here.
00:46 But this will let you work with the API
00:47 that we are building right there.
00:49 So what we do is we go and create a new Vue object
00:52 we tell it where it's going to run
00:53 we pass the data binding elements
00:55 like the movies and the genres
00:57 we give it methods like search
00:59 and it's called a lot of movies, if we go down to movies.
01:04 You see this going against our URL here
01:05 using a cool library called Axios.
01:07 All that stuff's included, I've committed all the stuff
01:10 under node modules so you don't have to
01:11 like, MPM initialize it or install the local stuff
01:15 all right, you just check it out and run it.
01:17 So, anyway, this stuff here, is going to be bound
01:20 over on this end, because we're saying, "Here's an ID."
01:26 And here's like a search input
01:27 and we're model binding the search text
01:30 and if you hit enter it calls that search function.
01:32 And then here, we're looping over all the genres
01:36 we're looping over all the movie results
01:37 and putting them here.
01:39 So now that we have our movie service here
01:42 running in PyCharm, I just minimize that.
01:45 Let's go over and run our Movie Explorer.
01:48 You can actually run that from PyCharm
01:50 or we can just run it from the file system
01:52 and I find that's a little simpler, so let's just do that.
01:54 Go over here to our index.html and, quote, "Run it,"
01:57 and we'll just open the HTML, it pulls in the JavaScript
02:00 it's going to do its magic.
02:01 So here you you can see that it's hitting our API
02:04 and I can show you that that is happening, right here
02:07 you can see it's doing some get request
02:09 of the API input there.
02:11 And we can do all sorts of cool stuff
02:13 so I can see the top 10 movies, I can select a movie
02:15 by genre, so let's go see the documentaries
02:18 "Butteryfly Girl," and whatnot
02:19 we can say show me the sports, then click on that.
02:22 Or you can show me the the drama, a very popular one.
02:25 Or you could even search for stuff
02:27 that's just, you know, fun to watch.
02:29 "Funny People," "Fun with Dick and Jane."
02:31 Apparently those are all in the comedy.
02:34 Okay, so this is the application
02:36 and if you look at the network, we go to just XHR
02:39 that's Ajax, basically.
02:43 You can see all those requests going back
02:44 to our API input, here, so localhost, API, search test.
02:50 Test two.
02:51 If we go and click the top 10, there's the movie top 10.
02:55 Movies by genre, here we go, API movie genre, adventure.
03:00 So we're not going to go into lots of detail about Vue JS
03:03 that's also covered in the Hundred Days of Web course
03:05 in great detail, but not here
03:08 because this is really not about Vue JS.
03:10 Nonetheless, hopefully, having this here to work with
03:15 comparing how you might call the service and define it
03:18 and then how you might interact with it
03:20 from a rich frontend framework, like Vue JS.
03:22 Hopefully that's interesting and adds some value for you.
03:25 Either way, all this code is in the get it repository
03:27 and you can go an play with it, as you like.
