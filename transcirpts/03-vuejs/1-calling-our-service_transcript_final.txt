00:00 Now before we talk about Vue.js properly
00:02 at least to quickly introduce the application
00:05 that I'm going to let you have to play with
00:07 the API that we'll be building here
00:08 let's just talk about some ways we can call our API.
00:12 Now, in the beginning, we just clicked on it in PyCharm
00:15 or opened a browser and typed in the address
00:17 and we just went there.
00:18 And that's kind of okay for get requests sometimes
00:21 unless you need to modify the header
00:23 but it's really hard to test post
00:25 and other types of verbs that way
00:26 so let me show you something better.
00:28 Let's start by actually just getting our app
00:30 to run again over here.
00:31 So this is a fresh copy we're going to work with
00:34 so let's go over here and go to that directory
00:37 and we're going to create a virtual environment
00:39 by running python3 -m venv venv.
00:42 Activate it and upgrade pip
00:44 'cause pip is always out of date
00:45 for virtual environments, it seems like.
00:47 So with that in place
00:49 we can come over here and open this in PyCharm.
00:54 All right, super. That's all loaded up.
00:56 Let's go in here and let's mark this directory.
01:01 That's a sources route
01:02 and we don't really have to mess with that.
01:03 That's just HTML and JavaScript, but I guess it won't hurt.
01:08 And mark it as a resource route
01:10 so it doesn't think things like ../jsfile
01:13 or whatever are missing.
01:15 Okay, so, also make sure that we have
01:17 the right thing running.
01:18 Yes, our virtual environment is there
01:20 so let's go into MovieDb Service.
01:25 Install our requirements, so this will run.
01:29 Great, looks like that worked.
01:31 Let's just go run our app.
01:32 We might need to change the directory
01:34 and wait for this to finish, this indexing.
01:37 All right, let's go and run that, see how this works.
01:39 Click on this. All right, beautiful.
01:42 It looks like our service is up and running here.
01:44 You've seen this from before.
01:46 So if we click here, we can test our little run
01:48 but let's try something besides just calling it a browser.
01:51 Let's go open Postman.
01:52 You can go and search for Postman in this app.
01:55 It's really nice, it's free.
01:57 Come over here and we can enter the URL
02:00 and send it and here we get, you can see a nice output.
02:03 We can, of course, tweak the body
02:06 make this a POST or PUT or something like that.
02:08 So if you want to explore and interact with the service
02:11 and test it a little bit better than with your browser
02:13 I recommend using Postman for that.
02:16 Of course, it's not an app, it's not as much fun
02:18 but it is a good way to explore your API
02:20 as you're building it.
