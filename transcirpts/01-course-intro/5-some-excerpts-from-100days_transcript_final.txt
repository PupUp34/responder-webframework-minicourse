00:00 Now some of the content
00:01 in fact the main demo where we build out this Responder API
00:05 comes from this other course that we're working on
00:08 and we have been working on for a long time
00:10 called 100 days of Web in Python.
00:13 Haven't heard of it?
00:14 That's because this is the first time
00:16 were publicly talking about it at all
00:18 so workin' on this with Bob Belderbos
00:20 and Julian Sequeira who helped
00:22 with the 100 days of Python course
00:24 100 days of Code in Python course
00:25 that we already did, and this is another
00:27 massive course covering all sorts of things
00:29 in the web framework world.
00:30 Vue JS, React, Flask, Django, Responder
00:34 APIStar, you name it.
00:36 If you want to dig into a bunch of different web frameworks
00:39 and kind of get a survey of the entire landscape
00:40 this is the course where we're doing that.
00:43 It's going to be like 25 hours of content
00:45 and it's going to be amazing.
00:46 So in the next chapter when we build out this API
00:49 some of that presentation is coming from
00:51 a little excerpt from his 100 Days of Web course.
00:55 Now, I didn't know anything about it
00:57 or have any experience with this 100 Days of Web course
01:00 but you'll see it in the demo links
01:02 like in the fold or path.
01:04 Things like that if you see that and
01:06 you're like, wait, what is this 100 Days of Web about?
01:08 Well, here's what it's about.
01:09 So we took this little bit of Responder
01:11 from the 100 Days of Web course
01:12 and we turned it into its own proper course
01:15 this little mini course that you can take right here.
01:18 That's what it's about, check this out.
01:19 It's not out yet at the time of the recording
01:22 but maybe the time of watching.
01:24 Anyway, if you subscribe to get notified
01:26 somehow at training.talkpython.fm
01:29 like you have an account and you haven't opted out
01:31 for example, you'll definitely hear about this
01:33 when it comes out.
01:34 Heads up, this a little excerpt from a really big course
01:37 that's been blown up to be its own proper course.
