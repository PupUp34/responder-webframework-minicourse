00:00 Now we're almost ready to start writing some code
00:02 and talking about this framework.
00:03 But before we do, let's just make sure everyone's on a
00:05 level playing field.
00:06 There's a couple things I want to share with you.
00:08 A couple things I want to give you.
00:09 And, also want to make sure you have what you need
00:12 to take this course.
00:13 So the first thing I'm want to start with is
00:15 what version of Python do you need.
00:17 Well of course we're on modern Python.
00:20 That in my mind I guess, is probably like
00:22 Python 3.5 and above.
00:24 But you're actually going to need Python 3.6 'cause
00:26 I believe we use some f-strings.
00:28 f-strings are a new way to format strings in Python
00:30 which are great.
00:31 Also it has async and await which came in 3.5
00:34 but I believe some of the features that were added
00:37 also required a little bit later.
00:39 So let's just say, 3.6 or later, maybe even 3.7.
00:42 Newer is better. You have to have Python installed
00:45 and it has to be Python 3.5 at an absolute minimum.
00:49 Ah, could be higher still. You may even wonder all
00:52 "That's great Michael I, really want to have Python installed
00:55 but do I on this particular machine".
00:57 I don't know. Well you can always ask.
00:59 You can go to your terminal in macOS or Linux
01:02 and type python3 -V and it will tell you, one of two things.
01:06 Either the version number or Python 3 not found.
01:09 If Python 3 not found, that means it's either not installed
01:12 or just not in your path.
01:13 But, you can see I got Python 3.7.2
01:15 that's almost the latest.
01:17 Just the day I started pressing record here, 3.7.3 came out.
01:22 Pretty much the same. On Windows, ah, python3 -V
01:26 sometimes works and you can get 3.7.2.
01:30 Depending on how you've installed Python.
01:32 You might have to type just python, without the 3, -V
01:35 and see what you get.
01:37 And especially on Windows 'çause until recently
01:39 could not target the version by the executable name.
01:43 You have to make sure your path is just right
01:45 so you can type "where python" on Windows I think
01:49 and "which python" on Mac and Linux.
01:51 If that's wrong, you can switch it.
01:52 It's either which or where
01:53 to show you where it's come from and if there is more
01:55 it'll show you which, which is in the path and where
01:57 you know which one comes first in the path and so on.
02:00 So if you have a new enough version of Python
02:03 super, let's rock and roll.
02:04 If you don't, refer you over to
02:06 realpython.com/installing-python
02:10 These guys have a really nice set of steps on giving this OS
02:14 here's how you get Python there
02:15 here's the trade off's and so on.
02:17 And, they're keeping it nice and up to date, so ah
02:21 instead of showing you how install and maybe
02:23 you know, six months there's some other way like
02:25 Windows 10 now just offered Python 3.7 in the store
02:29 which is a better way that getting it off
02:31 python.org for example.
02:32 So you can check out what they've got here.
02:34 This is pretty helpful and of course, you know
02:37 get modern Python all set up if you don't have it
02:38 and let's roll.
