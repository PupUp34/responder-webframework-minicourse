00:00 Now, we could use whatever editor we want
00:02 but I am a big fan of PyCharm.
00:04 I think PyCharm strikes a really nice balance
00:07 of not being too heavyweight
00:09 it's somewhat heavyweight, but it's really not that bad
00:11 with absolutely supporting proper web applications.
00:16 So, not only does it understand CSS and JavaScript and HTML
00:20 it knows Python really well
00:21 and it understands the relationships
00:22 between your CSS files, your static files
00:25 your Python files that you're working with.
00:28 It has nice refactoring.
00:29 All sorts of stuff.
00:31 So, we're going to be using PyCharm.
00:32 You can get the Community Edition
00:33 which will do most of what you need here.
00:36 It'll basically do everything except for give you
00:39 any form of support for the Jinja2 stuff
00:41 or the CSS editing, all right?
00:44 You could still create those files and edit them
00:46 I'm pretty sure
00:47 but with the free community edition
00:48 it won't do auto-complete within them.
00:50 They don't have native support for Responder
00:52 built in anyway, so that's not a huge shortcoming
00:55 but it is something to be aware of.
00:57 So we're going to use PyCharm Professional.
00:58 You can follow along with that.
01:00 Or use something else if you prefer
01:01 but here's how you can get the same editor
01:03 that we're using.
